# Python API Challenge

## Project Background

### **Background**
Use Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

For part 1, create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Use the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across cities.

For part 2, use weather data, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API to plan future vacations and create map visualizations.

### Data source:
All used data in this project is provided by UNC Chapel Hillâ€™s Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp.

### Files:
The WeatherPy folder contains all the files for this challenge project.
- The wp_output_data folder contains images created in WeatherPy.ipynb of figures created to visualize weather data and trends (Fig1.png, Fig2.png, Fig3.png, Fig4.png). It also contains the cities.csv file, also created in WeatherPy.ipynb, which contains all of the information pulled from openweatherapi for the each city found for this dataset.
- WeatherPy.ipynb - contains all the code used to analyze data, answer project questions, and make visualizations for part 1 of this challenge.
- VacationPy.ipynb - contains all the code used to analyze data, answer project questions, and make visualizations for part 2 of this challenge.
