The WeatherPy folder contains two Jupyter Notebooks.

The first one, WeatherPy.ipynb, contains the code used to make scatter plots and linear regression scatter plots for Latitude vs. Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. This file also saves a csv (cities.csv) that stored all of the information pulled from openweatherapi for the each city found for this dataset. cities.csv is saved into the folder wp_output_data. The folder wp_output_data also contains four images generated in WeatherPy.ipynb from the four scatter plot visualizations created.

The second Jupyter Notebook, VacationPy.ipynb, contains the code used to create an hvplot of every city in the cities.csv as well as a second hvplot of hotels based on shorter list of cities, filtered from cities.csv based on various criteria.
